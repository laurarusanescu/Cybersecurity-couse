## Basic Concepts in QKD Networks
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks use quantum mechanics to securely distribute encryption keys across multiple locations. Unlike classical networks, QKD ensures security based on fundamental physical principles rather than computational difficulty.

## Network Connections and Certificates
In QKD networks, secure communication relies on authenticated connections between nodes. Digital certificates are used to verify the identities of communicating parties and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## QKD Key Buffers
Key buffers temporarily store quantum-generated encryption keys before they are used in cryptographic applications. These buffers help manage key availability and synchronization between different parts of the network.

## ETSI 014 Workflow
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has defined a standard (ETSI GS QKD 014) that outlines best practices for integrating QKD into modern networks. This workflow ensures interoperability, security, and efficient key management.

## Consumer Paths
Consumer paths refer to the routes that encrypted data takes within a QKD network. Optimizing these paths ensures efficient and secure key distribution while minimizing latency and vulnerabilities.

## Trusted Nodes and Key Forwarding
Since direct quantum communication is limited by distance, **trusted nodes** act as relay points that forward QKD-generated keys between distant locations. These nodes must be secure to prevent key compromise.

## Practical QKD Deployment
Deploying QKD in real-world networks requires:
- Integration with existing infrastructure.
- Addressing environmental challenges (e.g., fiber attenuation, noise).
- Managing cost and scalability.
- Ensuring regulatory compliance.

## QKD Topologies
QKD networks can have different topologies, including:
- **Point-to-Point:** Direct QKD connections between two parties.
- **Star Topology:** A central hub distributes keys to multiple endpoints.
- **Mesh Topology:** Multiple interconnected nodes provide redundancy and security.

## Research Questions
Some ongoing research topics in QKD networks include:
- How can QKD be scaled for global communication?
- What are the best methods for integrating QKD with classical encryption?
- How can QKD be made cost-effective for widespread adoption?
- Can QKD be combined with post-quantum cryptography for enhanced security?
