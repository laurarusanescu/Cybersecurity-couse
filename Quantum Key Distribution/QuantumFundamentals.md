## Brief History of Quantum Computing
Quantum computing emerged as an idea in the 1980s when physicist Richard Feynman suggested that quantum systems are best simulated using quantum mechanics itself. Some key milestones:
- **1981:** Richard Feynman proposes quantum simulation.
- **1985:** David Deutsch formalizes the quantum Turing machine.
- **1994:** Peter Shor develops an algorithm for factoring large numbers efficiently (Shor’s Algorithm), which threatens classical cryptography.
- **1996:** Lov Grover introduces an algorithm for database searching.
- **2019:** Google claims quantum supremacy with a 53-qubit quantum processor (Sycamore).

## Quantum Bit (Qubit)
A **qubit** is the fundamental unit of quantum information, similar to a classical bit but with additional properties. While a classical bit can be either `0` or `1`, a qubit exists in a **superposition** of both states:

\[ |\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle \]

where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are complex numbers satisfying \( |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 \).

Unlike classical bits, qubits leverage quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations efficiently.

## Superposition and Mathematical Formalism
Superposition allows a qubit to exist in a combination of states simultaneously. Mathematically:

\[ |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \]

A multi-qubit system generalizes this property:

\[ |\psi\rangle = \alpha |00\rangle + \beta |01\rangle + \gamma |10\rangle + \delta |11\rangle \]

Superposition is one of the fundamental properties that gives quantum computing its power.

## Quantum Measurement
When a qubit is measured, it collapses to one of its basis states (`|0⟩` or `|1⟩`) with probabilities:

\[ P(0) = |\alpha|^2, \quad P(1) = |\beta|^2 \]

Measurement destroys the quantum state, a key difference from classical computing where information can be copied without disturbance.

## Single Qubit Gates
Quantum gates manipulate qubits, similar to classical logic gates. Some basic single-qubit gates:
- **Pauli-X (NOT) gate:** Flips `|0⟩` to `|1⟩` and vice versa.
- **Pauli-Y and Pauli-Z gates:** Phase-shifting operations.
- **Hadamard (H) gate:** Creates equal superposition.

Hadamard matrix:

\[ H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \]

Applying **H** to `|0⟩` results in:

\[ H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \]

## Multiple Qubit Systems and Gates
In multi-qubit systems, we use **tensor products** to describe states:

\[ |00\rangle = |0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle \]

Common multi-qubit gates:
- **CNOT (Controlled-NOT):** Flips the second qubit if the first qubit is `|1⟩`.
- **SWAP Gate:** Swaps two qubits.
- **Toffoli (CCNOT) Gate:** A 3-qubit gate used in quantum logic circuits.

## Examples: CNOT, Hadamard, SWAP, General n-Qubit Gates
- **CNOT:**

  \[ CNOT |00\rangle = |00\rangle, \quad CNOT |10\rangle = |11\rangle \]

  Matrix form:

  \[ CNOT = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \]

- **SWAP:** Interchanges two qubits:

  \[ SWAP (|01\rangle) = |10\rangle \]

- **General n-qubit gates:** Multi-qubit gates used for complex quantum algorithms.

## Walsh-Hadamard Transformation
A quantum version of the **Fourier Transform**, the **Walsh-Hadamard transform** applies the Hadamard gate to all qubits, creating equal superpositions.

For **n qubits**, the transformation is:

\[ H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^{\otimes n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} |x\rangle \]

Used in quantum algorithms like Grover’s search.

## No-Cloning Theorem
States that an **arbitrary quantum state cannot be copied**. If cloning were possible, it would violate quantum mechanics' linearity and allow faster-than-light communication.

Mathematically, if we could copy a state:

\[ U |\psi\rangle |e\rangle = |\psi\rangle |\psi\rangle \]

This is **impossible** for arbitrary **|ψ⟩**.

## Entanglement and Bell States
Quantum **entanglement** is a non-classical correlation between qubits. **Bell states** are maximally entangled two-qubit states:

\[ |\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle + |11\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{|01\rangle + |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \]

Measuring one qubit **instantly** determines the state of the other, no matter the distance between them.

## Quantum Teleportation Protocol
Quantum teleportation **transfers a qubit's state** using entanglement and classical communication. Steps:
1. Alice and Bob share an entangled Bell pair.
2. Alice entangles her unknown qubit with her Bell pair.
3. Alice measures and sends her result to Bob.
4. Bob applies a transformation based on Alice’s result, reconstructing the state.

Used in **quantum networks and cryptography**.
